Random code for my enjoyment and education,
do with it what ever you want.

Slackbot is a chat bot for slack.com.
It reacts to commands such as 'uhr' or 'wetter' after his callsign @servitor.
If the string contains any of these commands after the callsign,
it will execute.
For 'wetter', it will output the weather for every word in the string, except for wetter
